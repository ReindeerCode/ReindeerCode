### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, thank you for stopping by!

I'm not an artsy man and I'm not great with power tools. As a cruel joke I'm creative by nature and I've been searching for a creative outlet my entire life. Programming has filled this gap for me. I love that with programming I can create practically anything I can think of.


ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m a Sr. IT Analyst by day and programmer by night. ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working on a large scale passion project.

âš¡ Fun fact: I'm a giant, 6'7" tall.
