### Hi there 👋, thank you for stopping by!

I'm not an artsy man and I'm not great with power tools. As a cruel joke I'm creative by nature and I've been searching for a creative outlet my entire life. Programming has filled this gap for me. I love that with programming I can create practically anything I can think of.


🔭 I’m currently working on learning new languages to add as many tools to my programming toolbox as possible. 🌱 I’m currently learning TypeScript, MySQL, and React.

⚡ Fun fact: I'm a giant, 6'7" tall.
